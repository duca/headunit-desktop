/**
 * @brief Database abstraction class, used to fetch and insert/update data to/from the media library's SQLITE database
 *
 * QVariantMap and QVariantList is used as parameters and return types for convenience so we can easily pass data from and to QML
 * The media library currently uses 3 tables: locations, scanned_folders and media_files. Their purpose are as follows:
 *
 * ###locations###
 * We store the locations that are added to the database. Locations are used as the root for media files that are scanned and added
 * to the DB. To add a new location we have to first find the root for the partition its located at. The root of the partition will be stored
 * in the 'volume_path' filed. Then we have to find a unique identifier for the partition which we will store in the 'volume_unique_id' field.
 * The 'relative_path' is used to store the added locations path relative to the volume's root. This is done this way so if the mounting point
 * for the drive changes we can change it simply without having to delete the location and completely rescan it. This will also help us later
 * when implementing separated database files for each partition.
 *
 *   - name (text) - Used to store the drive label. This field is purely for display purposes.
 *   - relative_path (text) - The path to the location relative to the mounting point of the volume
 *   - volume_unique_id (text) - The UUID of the volume (on Linux this may be found in /dev/disk/by-uuid)
 *   - volume_path (text) - The path to the volume (on Linux this is the mount point on Windows its the drive letter)
 *   - is_present (integer) - This indicates whether if the volume is mounted and accessible or not. Possible values : 1 (true) | 0 (false). If this field is set
 * to 0 the media files and folders from this location will be excluded from all queries.
 *
 * ###scanned_folders###
 * This table is used to store the folders that were found and scanned within a location. The fields are used as follows:
 *   - name  (text) - The name of the folder
 *   - location_id  (integer) - The foreign key for the location this folder is located in.
 *   - relative_path  (text) - The path to the folder relative to the location path (this excludes the folder name)
 *   - last_modified (text) - The last modified stamp of the folder (currently not used)
 *   - has_audio (integer) - Indicates whether if there are any audio files directly in the folder. possible values : 1 (true) | 0 (false)
 *   - has_video (integer) - Indicates whether if there are any video files directly in the folder. possible values : 1 (true) | 0 (false)
 *   - thumbnail (text) - The name of the thumbnail image
 *
 * ###media_files###
 * This table contains the media files that were found in the scanned folders.
 *   - filename (text) - The name of the media file including the file type extension
 *   - folder_id (text) - The foreign key for the folder that contains the media file.
 *   - media_type (integer) - The media type id. Possible values are: 1 (AUDIO) | 2 (VIDEO) | 3 (PLAYLIST)
 *   - artist (text) (optional, only for audio files) - The performing artist of the audio file (parsed from i3d)
 *   - title (text) (optional, only for audio files) - The title of the audio file (parsed from i3d)
 *   - album (text) (optional, only for audio files) - The album of the audio file (parsed from i3d)
 *   - genre (text) (optional, only for audio files) - The genre of the audio file (parsed from i3d)
 *
 *
 * @todo Create separate SQLITE databases for each partition and store it in the volume root rather than a single file next to executable
 * @todo Add favourites
 * @todo Add custom playlists
